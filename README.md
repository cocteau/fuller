### Data 2 syllabus and R files

Andrea, here are the files I used. Things should be numbered and I hope it all makes sense. If you have any questions at all let me know. My basic strategy was to take ideas from current stories and use them as an anchor to talk through clustering, regression, smoothing, various other kinds of machine learning, data visualization... 

Enjoy!
