The article is called [Spies in the Skies](https://www.buzzfeed.com/peteraldhous/spies-in-the-skies). Please read the article, thinking about the ways data informed their narrative.\n",

    "The authors make use of a construction for orchestrating computations in R that we haven't covered yet. It's called a \"pipe\". It is a common construction in many languages, and you might recognize it from the UNIX shell. There is a nice [description of pipes in R here](https://www.r-statistics.com/2014/08/simpler-r-coding-with-pipes-the-present-and-future-of-the-magrittr-package/).\n",
    "\n",
    "The symbol \"%>%\" is known as a pipe. It means taking the data that is output by one command and feeding it as input to the following command. So, if we want to filter() the crime data below to just \"MANHATTAN\" incidents and then sample_n() 25 of them, we might do the following."

Notice that the first arugment to filter() and sample_n() and all of the \"dplyr\" functions is a data set. We drop reference to those data sets when using pipes because the data are taken from the previous command  in the \"pipeline\". \n",

    "Old school R (back when it was S) used \"<-\" instead. The motivation was twofold. First, on an old AT&T Terminal (APL keyboard as well), there was a single key that represented an arrow sign. So it was as easy to type as \"=\". Second, if there was a convenient second symbol that could represent assignment, the authors of the language thought it would be easier for a novice to differentiate that \"x <- 5\" means assign the label \"x\" to the value 5; and that sample_n(size=5) means pass the value of 5 under the name \"size\" in the function \"sample_n\". \n",
    "\n",
    "The way I've taught you, \"=\" could mean create a new variable or pass a value into a function. It was felt that that could be confusing for beginners and \"<-\" was born. What do you think? \n",
