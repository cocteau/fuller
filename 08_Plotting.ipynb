    "Plotting tools in R\n",
    "------------------\n",
    "\n",
    "We've spent a lot of time with old-school plotting frameworks in R, in particular plot() and boxplot() and hist(). Today we'll see how to customize these and also provide a few other frameworks that \"expose\" their functionality a bit more cleanly. As we will see, there are several graphics packages in R. \n",
    "\n",
    "Why? Over the years, different approaches for how to structure and work with statistical graphics have come into fashion. \n",
    "\n",
    "Initially, data analysis was not the sort of thing a self-respecting academic would do. You'd ask your graduate students to generate a graphs or run an analysis for you. They would deliver a stack of paper and you would interpret the results. Then, in the 1970's John Tukey transformed data analysis into an honest intellectual exercise. In his text \"Exploratory Data Analysis\" he formulated a style of analysis that really informs programs like R. To Tukey, data analysis was a cyclic process involving multiple views of a data set. From simple numerical summaries to more advanced graphical representations. The data analyst would cycle between her ideas about patterns and relationships in the data, and computations that validate or contradict these ideas. Hypothesis leads to computation leads to hypothesis and so on.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41QMTYHJ4QL.jpg\">\n",
    "\n",
    "To Tukey, the more views you had of the data, the better. In the early 70s he developed a tool for interactive data visualization that generated an unbounded number of views. To get a sense of what I mean by interactive exploration, you can try a more recent program [ggobi](http://www.ggobi.org/). \n",
    "\n",
    "The struggle to find structure in data is really what statistics is all about. It's hard, however, to see data in more than 3 dimensions (scatterplots using x, y and z, say) and so the hunt was on to find a framework for teasing out patterns. This could be done with formal models (like regression) or other kinds of graphical displays that  extend the tried and true techniques like scatterplots. In the early 1990s this led to something called conditional plots or trellis displays (lattice in R). We'll see these also.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, novelty. There was a desire to formalize and then expose the process by which basic graphics were made. So let's not start with a scatterplot and see what we can do with it, but instead break it down to its constitutent parts and develop a new framework for graphics from the bottom up. This is the spirit of the Grammar of Graphics or ggplot(2) in R.\n",
    "\n",
    "OK, too much chatter. Let's make some pictures. We are going to use a data set associated with a [simple story from the NYT about the hardest places to live in the United States.](http://www.nytimes.com/2014/06/26/upshot/where-are-the-hardest-places-to-live-in-the-us.html?_r=0) It is county-level data. Quoting The UpShot, it consists of \"six data points for each county in the United States: education (percentage of residents with at least a bachelor’s degree), median household income, unemployment rate, disability rate, life expectancy and obesity. We then averaged each county’s relative rank in these categories to create an overall ranking.\" Here's the data."

    "The last major graphics system (aside from special graphics that come along with new models, say) is ggplot -- well, ggplot2. It comes from Lee Wilkinson's book \"Grammar of Graphics.\" In it, Wilkinson tried to come up with a system for describing any plot. It was meant to not only recreate existing graphical forms, but allow for the creation of new ones. \n",
    "\n",
    "\"ggplot2\" was created by, well it's getting old now but, Hadley Wickham. You can read [the formal documentation](http://docs.ggplot2.org/current/index.html). There is also [a great cheetsheat for ggplot2](https://www.rstudio.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/ggplot2-cheatsheet-2.1.pdf) and I recommend this [tutorial for ggplot2](http://zevross.com/blog/2014/08/04/beautiful-plotting-in-r-a-ggplot2-cheatsheet-3/).
