    "The libraries we are going to use today in R are simply **interfaces to powerful stand-alone applications.** We are going to download, for example, some sophisticated map making software, but call it from the comfort of R. This is a common design pattern. Data analysts will often prefer to access new software through R commands. Why? Well, it means that someone has translated the functionality of the other software into R and the data analyst doesn't have to learn something entirely new. It also means that the data analyst can leverage all the other code in R to analyze the data that is produced by this other system. So for a variety of reasons, R becomes a kind of integration platform.\n",
